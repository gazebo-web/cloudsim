// Selector is used to uniquely identify a Platform.
type Selector string

// Set contains a set of platforms that can be used by Cloudsim.
// Implementations must be simple platform containers and must not be aware of the feature sets, differences (if any) or
// implementation details of the available platforms they contain. This is by design, in order to give applications the
// flexibility to manage sets of platforms as they see fit.
// All contained platforms are completely independent from each other. As an example, you can have a set of platforms
// that use the same internal components (e.g. AWS+Kubernetes), but that are configured to point to different
// service regions. At the same time, it is possible to have additional platforms making use of entirely different
// components (e.g. GCP+Mesos, Azure+Swarm) co-exist with the set of AWS+Kubernetes platforms.
// Every platform is uniquely identified by a Selector, a user-defined identifier. To make use of a specific platform,
// the target platform's Selector is passed to the Set implementation through the Platform method.
// An example of a selector set:
//   * aws_k8s_us_east_1 - Platform containing AWS and Kubernetes components pointed at us-east-1.
//   * aws_k8s_us_east_2 - Platform containing AWS and Kubernetes components pointed at us-east-2.
//   * gcp_mesos - Platform containing GCE and Apache Mesos components.
//   * azure_swarm - Platform containing Azure and Docker Swarm components.
