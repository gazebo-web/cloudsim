// be used to configure specific aspects of a circuit/application (e.g.
// max_submissions - A custom rule for a specific owner to allow for
// extra submissions in a specific circuit). Rules for several owners or
// circuits can be defined by creating rules with NULL values in either fields.
// Rules with NULL values have less priority than rules with values, with the
// following priority: owner, circuit. This means that a rule with NULL circuit
// and owner will apply to ALL circuits for ALL owners, but any rule with either
// circuit or owner will override this general rule.
