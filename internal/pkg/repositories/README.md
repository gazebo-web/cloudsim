# Repositories package
The goal of this document is to explain how to use the generic repository interface. As it is right now, it supports the following ORMs:
- GORM

## Interfaces
This package groups a set of interfaces to `Create`, `Find`, `Update` and `Delete` entities from a certain database. It makes use of the `Entity` interface to define tables that will have the information provided with the repository.

### Entity interface
The entity interface groups a set of methods to define the naming convention of a certain entity in the whole system. It also has a method that returns the table name for that specific entity.
```golang
type Entity interface {
	// TableName returns the table/collection name for a certain entity.
	TableName() string
	// SingularName returns the entity's name in singular.
	SingularName() string
	// PluralName returns the entity's name in plural.
	PluralName() string
}
```

### Repository interface
The repository interface, as described above in this section, includes a set of methods to perform CRUD operations with a certain entity.
It makes use of another interface called Filter in order to select the entities that will be used to perform those CRUD operations.

```golang
type Repository interface {
	Create([]domain.Entity) ([]domain.Entity, error)
	Find(output interface{}, offset, limit *int, filters ...Filter) error
	FindOne(entity domain.Entity, filters ...Filter) error
	Update(data domain.Entity, filters ...Filter) error
	Delete(filters ...Filter) error
	SingularName() string
	PluralName() string
	Model() domain.Entity
}
```

### Filter interface
```golang
type Filter interface {
	Template() string
	Values() []interface{}
}
```

## GORM
We've created a gorm implementation that satisfies the interfaces described before. In the following section you'll find a couple of examples to help you understand how to use this specific implementation in your codebase.

### Setup
First of all, you need to set up a model and implement the Entity interface.

```golang
type Car struct {
    gorm.Model
    Color string
    Owner string
}

// You can avoid adding the TableName() here since gorm.Model already includes it.
func (Car) TableName() string {
	return "cars"
}

func (Car) SingularName() string {
	return "Car"
}

func (Car) PluralName() string {
	return "Cars"
}
```

After that, you'll need to initialize gorm's repository implementation. `NewGormRepository()` accepts 3 arguments: A `*gorm.DB` instance, an implementation for the `ign.Logger` interface, and a pointer to an entity of type `Car` that we created before.
```golang
func main() {
    db, err := gorm.Open(...)
    if err != nil {
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    
    carLogger := ign.NewLoggerNoRollbar("cars", ign.VerbosityDebug) // Use your own.
    
    repository := repositories.NewGormRepository(db, carLogger, &Car{})
}
```

And that's it! Now you're ready to start using this implementation.

### Repository
In this section we're going take a look at the different methods to perform CRUD operations with our brand-new entity.

#### Create car
```golang
func CreateCars(repository repositories.Repository) {
    cars := []Car{
        {
            Color:  "Red",
            Owner:  "Owner A",
        },
        {
            Color:  "Blue",
            Owner:  "Owner B",
        },
        {
            Color:  "Green",
            Owner:  "Owner C",
        },
    }

    var entities []domain.Entity
    for _, c := range cars {
        entities = append(entities, &c)
    }
    _, err := repository.Create(entities)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Error: %+v", err)
    }
    return
}
```
