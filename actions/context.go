// Context is used to send context data to jobs. Context should be used to provide access to platforms, services,
// loggers, etc.
// Applications are free to add values to a Context through a context.Context object, but should be careful not to
// replace values set by other actors. It is recommended to create a set of constants to use as keys, where each key is
// composed of an application prefix followed by an identifier.
// Note that any information that must be passed between jobs should not be passed using a context, and should be
// returned by the job instead. This is because return values are automatically persisted, which allows an action to
// recover after an unexpected stop (e.g. server restart), while context is lost. The context should only be used to
// pass application-specific values used by jobs, and can be used to support a simple dependency injection scheme.
